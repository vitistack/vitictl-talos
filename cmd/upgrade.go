"viti talos upgrade-node" and "viti talos upgrade-k8s".

Checks GitHub for the latest released version of the viti-talos plugin and, if
a newer release is available, prints the command that upgrades it.

viti-talos ships no installer of its own. It is a viti plugin, so upgrades go
through "viti plugin upgrade talos", which downloads the release, verifies its
SHA-256 checksum and (when cosign is installed) its Sigstore signature, and
replaces the binary atomically. Pass --run to have this command invoke that
for you.`,

  viti talos upgrade --run
  viti talos upgrade --run --yes`,
